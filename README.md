   On Windows:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Deactivate the virtual environment (when done):**
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

# Dataset Location:

## Go to this link to automatically download the zip files that contain our datasets
## NOTE: The first link is very large, around 293 MBs zipped, so be ready for that
## Once the datasets are downloaded, extract the csvs and add them to the project structure underneath the root, the gitignore should leave out these files
## DO NOT change the name of the csv files!
